# Max Widths

The max-widths module contains both a ten-step scale based on powers of two as well as the ability to constrain element widths to a maximum of 100%.

Max widths can be combined with widths to ensure that your content doesnâ€™t get too wide on larger monitors. Max-widths can also help keep embedded media within the canvas. As they are fluid across ranges of screen widths, max-widths are extremely useful when trying to keep a design responsive.
